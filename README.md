# Colombo Stock Exchange Data Scraper for MetaStock

This project is a personal experiment to extract daily stock data from the [Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)](https://www.cse.lk/) website and convert it into a format compatible with **MetaStock**, a popular technical analysis platform.

Since the CSE doesn't offer a free data stream, this scraper was built to bridge that gap — enabling offline charting, pattern analysis, and historical trend visualization directly within MetaStock.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Scrapes daily stock data** from the official Colombo Stock Exchange site  
- **Parses and formats the data** into MetaStock-compatible structure  
- **Feeds the data into MetaStock** for analysis  
- **Used for learning** pattern recognition, price action, and buy/sell signal validation  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project was intended as a **technical and educational exercise**. While the tool enabled me to visualize data and detect patterns, it was not used for consistent or successful trading.

## 🧠 Motivation

At the time, I was exploring technical analysis and wanted to understand Sri Lankan equities better. MetaStock seemed like a good fit, but lacked a free feed for CSE data — so I built my own. This project gave me hands-on experience with:

- Web scraping and data sanitization  
- Data formatting for financial systems  
- Using charting tools to identify potential trading signals  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java for scraping and transformation  
- Custom formatting logic for MetaStock integration  

## 📂 Structure


## 📈 Sample Output

MetaStock-ready output files are generated in the format required for import into the software. These files can be batch imported to visualize price movement and historical patterns.

## 🔍 Lessons Learned

- The importance of clean, structured data in financial modeling  
- Challenges of working with unofficial or unstructured web sources  
- How technical tools like MetaStock interpret and visualize market data
